### VOR Simulator App [Free]
#### https://hub.pilotinstitute.com/vor-app
###### Interactive VOR simulator for pilot training.
An excellent example of a focused, single-purpose training tool from the Pilot Institute. It shows how a complex concept like VOR navigation can be broken down into an interactive, web-based simulation. This inspires the modularity of our own simulator features.

### Asset: Analogical Flight Instruments
#### https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/analogical-flight-instruments-gui-code-152685
###### A Unity asset for flight instrument GUIs.
This Unity asset demonstrates how to separate instrument logic from its visual representation. While built for Unity and C#, the same principles apply here. Our JavaScript `Aircraft` class holds the state (speed, altitude), and a rendering module (like `display.js`) could use that data to drive similar-looking SVG or Canvas-based gauges, creating a more immersive cockpit feel.
