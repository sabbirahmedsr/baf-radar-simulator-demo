### Asset: Analogical Flight Instruments
#### https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/analogical-flight-instruments-gui-code-152685
###### A Unity asset for flight instrument GUIs.
This Unity asset demonstrates how to separate instrument logic from its visual representation. While built for Unity and C#, the same principles apply here. Our JavaScript `Aircraft` class holds the state (speed, altitude), and a rendering module (like `display.js`) could use that data to drive similar-looking SVG or Canvas-based gauges, creating a more immersive cockpit feel.
