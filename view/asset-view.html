  <h2>Asset: Analogical Flight Instruments</h2>
  <p>A collection of flight instruments for Unity GUI, designed for flight simulators on PC and mobile devices. This asset provides a great example of modular UI components that could be adapted for a web-based simulator.</p>

      <h3>Technical Details & Relevance</h3>
      <p>This asset demonstrates how to separate instrument logic from its visual representation. While built for Unity and C#, the same principles apply here. Our JavaScript `Aircraft` class holds the state (speed, altitude), and a rendering module (like `display.js`) could use that data to drive similar-looking SVG or Canvas-based gauges, creating a more immersive cockpit feel.</p>
